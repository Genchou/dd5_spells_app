Perhaps you tried to scry\n          an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are\n          attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.<br/><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.\n          Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force\n          damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up\n          (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).<br/><strong>Similar Area</strong>.

You and\n          your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the\n          destination in a random direction.

Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit\n          Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and\n          Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might\n          cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.<br/>If you\n          maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the\n          wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.

    "description": "<div class=\"description\">\n<em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply\n          speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.<br/>The basic use of\n          this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you\n          use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that\n          spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.<br/>Alternatively,\n          you can create one of the following effects of your choice:<br/><strong>Object Creation</strong>. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a\n          magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension,\n          and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the\n          ground.<br/><strong>Instant Health</strong>. You allow yourself and\n          up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and\n          you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration\n          spell.<br/><strong>Resistance</strong>. You grant up to ten creatures\n          that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This\n          Resistance is permanent.<br/><strong>Spell Immunity</strong>. You\n          grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or\n          other magical effect for 8 hours.<br/><strong>Sudden Learning</strong>. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are\n          eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the\n          benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a\n          prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.<br/><strong>Roll Redo</strong>. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll\n          made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality\n          reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\n          <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a\n          foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage\n          or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the\n          original roll.<br/><strong>Reshape Reality</strong>. You may wish for\n          something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state\n          your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great\n          latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the\n          wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell\n          might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in\n          part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how\n          you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead\n          might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no\n          longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly,\n          wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly\n          transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your\n          wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole\n          community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes.\n          If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might\n          instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the\n          wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse\n          itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any\n          way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her\n          head, and your wish fails.<br/>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to\n          produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.\n          After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you\n          finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that\n          spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In\n          addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of\n          those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light\n          activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally,\n          there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\n          <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.<br/>\n</div>",

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the\n          same effect or choose a different one.<br/><strong>Flood</strong>.\n          You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by\n          as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water,\n          you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of\n          the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles\n          in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side.

You part water in the area\n          and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and\n          the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains\n          until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then\n          slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the\n          normal water level is restored.<br/><strong>Redirect Flow</strong>.\n          You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose,\n          even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other\n          unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but\n          once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on\n          the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose\n          until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br/><strong>Whirlpool</strong>. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must\n          be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until\n          you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5\n          feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet\n          tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is\n          pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the\n          first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength\n          saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning\n          damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.\n          A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an\n          action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check\n          against your spell save DC.<br/>\n</div>",

You\n          inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of\n          floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or\n          chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger\n          than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than\n          10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the\n          spell ends without being triggered.<br/>The glyph is nearly\n          imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check\n          against your spell save DC to notice.<br/>When you inscribe the\n          glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune\n          or a spell glyph, as explained below.<br/><strong>Set the Trigger</strong>. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For\n          glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or\n          stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or\n          approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed\n          within an object, common triggers include opening that object or\n          seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br/>You\n          can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types\n          activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect\n          Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't\n          trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br/><strong>Explosive Rune</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a\n          20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area\n          makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire,\n          Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph)\n          on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by\n          casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a\n          single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate\n          effect when cast in this way.<br/>When the glyph is triggered, the\n          stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the\n          creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the\n          area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile\n          creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as\n          possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires\n          Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.<br/><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</em></strong>. The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell\n          slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any\n          spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the Glyph\n          of Warding.<br/>\n</div>",

A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.<br/><strong><em>Targeted Effects</em></strong>.

The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=fireball\">fireball</a></em>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=wall-of-fire\">wall of fire</a></em> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.<br/><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.<br/><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.<br/>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.<br/><strong><em>Magical Travel</em></strong>. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.

You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.<br/><strong><em>Part Water</em></strong>. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.<br/><strong><em>Redirect Flow</em></strong>. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.<br/><strong><em>Whirlpool</em></strong>. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.<br/>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.<br/>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.<br/></div>",

Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br/>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br/>When you inscribe the glyph, choose <em>explosive runes</em> or a <em>spell glyph</em>.<br/><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/><strong>Spell Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.<br/><strong><em>At Higher Levels</em></strong>. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a <em>spell glyph</em>, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the <em>glyph of warding</em>.<br/></div>",

That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).<br/>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.<br/>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.<br/>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.<br/>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.<br/>If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.<br/>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.<br/></div>",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.<br/>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.<br/>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.<br/>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br/>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br/><strong>Fear</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.<br/><strong>Hopelessness</strong>. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.<br/><strong>Insanity</strong>. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.<br/><strong>Pain</strong>. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.<br/><strong>Sleep</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.<br/><strong>Stunning</strong>. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.<br/></div>",

Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.<br/>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.<br/><strong><em>Chaining</em></strong>. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.<br/>The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.<br/><strong><em>Hedged Prison</em></strong>. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.<br/>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.<br/><strong><em>Minimus Containment</em></strong>. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.<br/>The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.<br/><strong><em>Slumber</em></strong>. The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.<br/>The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.<br/><strong><em>Ending the Spell</em></strong>. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.<br/>A <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a></em> spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.<br/>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.<br/></div>",

As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.<br/>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.<br/>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.<br/>The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.<br/>An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.<br/>The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.<br/>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.<br/>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.<br/></div>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.<br/><strong><em>Similar Area</em></strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.<br/><strong><em>Mishap</em></strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).<br/></div>",

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.<br/><strong>Antipathy</strong>. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.<br/><strong>Sympathy</strong>. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.<br/>If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.<br/><strong>Ending the Effect</strong>. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.<br/>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.<br/></div>",

It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.<br/>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.<br/>Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.<br/>This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.<br/>Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.<br/></div>",

    "description": "<div class=\"description petit\"><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.<br/>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.<br/>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:<br/>• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.<br/>• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=greater-restoration\">greater restoration</a></em> spell.<br/>• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.<br/>• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.<br/>• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>wish</em> spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.<br/>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.<br/>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast <em>wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.<br/></div>",

Blue</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.<br/><strong>6. Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.<br/>While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=daylight\">daylight</a></em> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.<br/><strong>7. Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a <em><a href=\"https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a></em> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.<br/></div>",

That entity sends a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).<br/>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.<br/>Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.<br/>A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.<br/>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.<br/></div>",
